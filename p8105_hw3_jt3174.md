## **Problem 1**

This problem uses the Instacart data. DO NOT include this dataset in
your local data directory; instead, load the data from the
p8105.datasets using:

``` r
# find the specific data file
data("instacart")

# Part: Aisle

aisle_data = instacart %>% 
  # group by aisle name
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  # count the number of order for each aisle
  summarize(n_aisle = n()) %>% 
  # sort this list descendently, so the first row is the most ordered aisle
  arrange(desc(n_aisle))

aisle_data
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                         n_aisle

Short description of the dataset:

This dataset called instacart is a dataset contains information about
online grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and there
are 1384617 observations of 131209 customers in the year of 2017, where
each row in the dataset is a product from an order. There is a single
order per user in this dataset.

There are 15 variables in this dataset:

  - order\_id: order identifier
  - product\_id: product identifier
  - add\_to\_cart\_order: order in which each product was added to cart
  - reordered: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the
    past, 0 otherwise
  - user\_id: customer identifier
  - eval\_set: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the
    data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train”
    eval\_set)
  - order\_number: the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
    n=nth)
  - order\_dow: the day of the week on which the order was placed
  - order\_hour\_of\_day: the hour of the day on which the order was
    placed
  - days\_since\_prior\_order: days since the last order, capped at 30,
    NA if order\_number=1
  - product\_name: name of the product
  - aisle\_id: aisle identifier
  - department\_id: department identifier
  - aisle: the name of the aisle
  - department: the name of the department

Some of the key variables are reordered (this tells you whether the item
was repurchased or not), and days\_since\_prior\_order (this tells you
how long it takes to reorder an item).

There are 134 aisles, and the most popular aisle is fresh vegetables.

\#\#**Problem 2** This problem uses the BRFSS data. DO NOT include this
dataset in your local data directory; instead, load the data from the
p8105.datasets package.

First, do some data cleaning:

format the data to use appropriate variable names; focus on the “Overall
Health” topic include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” organize
responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”
Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010? Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help). Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

\#\#**Problem 3** Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to
self-report techniques for studying physical activity in observational
studies and clinical trials, largely because of their relative
objectivity. During observation periods, the devices measure “activity
counts” in a short period; one-minute intervals are common. Because
accelerometers can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce
around-the-clock observations.

This problem uses five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care
Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure (CHF). The data can be downloaded here. In this
spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the activity counts for each
minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc). Traditional
analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day.
Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to create a total
activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals.
Are any trends apparent? Accelerometer data allows the inspection
activity over the course of the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows
the 24-hour activity time courses for each day and use color to indicate
day of the week. Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can
make based on this graph.
